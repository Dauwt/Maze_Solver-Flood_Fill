# Maze Solver - Flood Fill
A Python Script That Uses The Flood Fill Algorithm To Solve Mazes!

## How It Works

### Instaling The Libraries

First of all get the libraries needed by using `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal! Then just open **main.py** and run it!  
  
### Creating a **venv**

I recommend creating a **venv** for this project, you can do so by using this command `python -m venv myenv` and then activate it by using this command `myenv\Scripts\activate`! Now you can use this **venv** to **install the libraries on this project!**

### Understanding The Code

This Script uses the **Flood Fill Algoritm** to find the **shortest path** of a maze!  
You can **change the maze** by changing these variables, [borders_map](./main.py#L26) and [win_cells_map](./main.py#L28)!

## From The Creator

### Why I Did Make This Project

Like many of you guys I like to challenge my self and make cool projects!  
In this case I specifically made this project because I was inspired by the **MicroMouse Competition**!

### How To Make This Project Cooler

If you want to make **more features** to this code I recommend trying to make a **Maze Editor**, where you can **create the mazes** in a grid and autommaticly saving the maze!
